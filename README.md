MongoDASH - Yet another Mongo Monitor
---

This app was initially developed as a POC based on the existing and expensive MMC. It became quite an interesting project but unfortunately I didn't have time to continue working on it.

Frontend was done based on some templates and mixed with the controllers - not very proud of that. Also, when I started this project, Mongo was on version 2.6.

As part of this project, there is also an agent that can be installed on the Mongo nodes. I'll create a new repo for that.  

A preview is available at: http://demo.mongodash.com - not guaranteed to be up 100% of the time :neutral_face:


Some items on my TODO list:

* Replace FE with ReactJS / Webpack
* Update to Java 8 and Tomcat 8
* Update Mongo support to v3.0
* Expose APIs as micro-services
